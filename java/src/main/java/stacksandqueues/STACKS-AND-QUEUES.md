# Stacks and Queues

Code Challenges given at Code Fellows at the 401 level that all deal with stacks and queues

## Challenge

Implementing Stacks and Queues with all of the APIs that are listed bellow

## API

### Stack

**push()**

Method that takes in any value as an argument and adds a new node with the value to the *top* of the stack

**pop()**

Method does not take in any arguments and removes the node from the *top* of the stack and returns the node's value

**peek()**

Method that doesn't take an argument and returns the value of the node located on the top of the stack, without removing it from the stack

**isEmpty()**

Method that doesn't take an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty

### Queue

**enqueue()**

Method that takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue

**dequeue()**

Method that does not take in an argument, removes the node from the front of the queue and returns the node's value

**peek()**

Method that does not take in an argument, returns the value of node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue

**isEmpty()**
