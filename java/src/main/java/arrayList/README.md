# ArrayList Study

## Grocery List Application

- To get used to what an ArrayList is and how it operates, I am creating a grocery list application
- Methods that have been created:
   - Add an item
   - Printing out the list
   - Modifying a single item in the grocery list
   - Deleting an item from the grocery list
   - Find an item in the grocery list
   
## Simple Mobile Phone 

- Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone, it needs to do the following:
    - Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names
    - Master class called MobilePhone, that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
    - Create a simple class for Contacts (name and phone number)
    - Menu options:
        - Quit
        - Print list of contacts
        - Add New Contact
        - Update existing contact
            - When adding and updating contacts, make sure that the contact exists (use name)
        - Remove contact
        - Search/find contacts
    - ArrayList inner workings should not be exposed to MobilePhone
        - e.g. no ints, no .get(i), etc
    - MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only
