## Challenge

- Create a program that implements a playlist for songs
- Create a Song class having Title and Duration for a song
- The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs
- Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in order they are added

    1. Quit
    2. Skip forward to the next song
    3. Skip backwards to the previous song
